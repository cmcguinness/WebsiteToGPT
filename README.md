# Website to GPT
This is a set of tools I used to try to generate an index to my substack that I could use with GPT
(Specifically, the kind built with the interactive GPT Builder) that would allow it to find articles
in my substack that might help it answer questions (and them retrieve them, I hoped).

This is here as a sort of food-for-thought offering, not intended to be used as is.
